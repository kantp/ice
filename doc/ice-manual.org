#+BEGIN_abstract
This is the manual of ICE, a program to choose a maximal linearly
independent subset from a given set of Integration-by-Parts and/or
Lorentz Invariance equations.  The algorithm it implements is
described in \cite{solve}, and the author considers it good practice
to cite this paper when the program is used in a calculation leading
to a scientific publication.
#+END_abstract

* Installation
The easiest way to compile the program from source is to use the cabal
build system.  It is included in the Haskell Platform[fn:http://www.haskell.org/platform/], which is
available on most modern systems, including GNU/Linux, Windows, and
OS/X.  If you have the Haskell Platform installed, the following
commands, executed from the sourcedirectory, will install all needed
libraries and compile the program
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal configure
cabal build
#+END_SRC
This will create the executable file =./dist/build/ice/ice=.
Alternatively, there are binary executables for some systems available
from

http://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/pep/tools.
* Usage
ICE is run as
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ice [OPTIONS] [FILE]
#+END_SRC
where the following options are available:
- =-d --dumpfile=FILE= :: In addition to the output on stdout, print
     a list of newline-separated equation numbers to =FILE=.  Note
     that the equations are zero-indexed.
- =--intname=NAME= :: This is used to control the name of the
     function representing integrals in the input file.  The default
     is =Int=.
- =-i --invariants=x= :: Add the symbol =x= to the list of variables
     that appear in the polynomials.
- =-b --backsub= :: After forward substitution, perform backward
     substitution in order to determine which master
     integrals appear in the result for each integral.
- =-r --rmax=n=, =-s --smax=n= :: Only relevant if =--backsub= is
     given.  Do not try to find a representation for integrals with
     more than =rmax= dots or more than =smax= scalar products.  A
     system of IBP equations will typically contain some integrals
     with many dots and/or scalar products (more than the integrals
     used as seeds in the generation of the system) that can not be
     determined by the system, but are not master integrals and could
     be reduced if the system was enlarged.  Discarding those before
     the backward substitution saves some time.
The input file =FILE= should have the following syntax:
- Each line gives one term in an equation in the form 
  \\
  =Int[<indices>]*(<sum of coefficients>)=
  \\ The brackets are mandatory.
- Equations are terminated and separated by a line consisting of only
  a semicolon.
For an example, see the following section.

In order to illustrate the usage of the program, we give a
simple example input file for the reduction of the diagram shown
in Figure\nbsp\ref{fig:se1l}.  The input file with the equations is found in
=example/se1l.in=.  It contains equations to reduce one scalar product
and one dot, with invariants =d= and =m=.  The command line to run ICE
on this file is
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./dist/build/ice/ice -id -im example/se1l.in
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./dist/build/ice/ice -id -im -r1 -s1 --backsub example/se1l.in
#+END_SRC
In the latter case, ICE also determines which master integrals are
needed to express each integral with at most one dot and/or one
scalar product.
The output will look similar to
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ICE -- Integration-By-Parts Chooser of Equations
Command line arguments: Config {inputFile = "example/se1l.in"
, dumpFile = "", intName = "Int", intNumbers = False
, invariants = ["d","m"], rMax = 1, sMax = 1, backsub = True}
Number of equations: 8

Random points: [2887887967,690347565]
Number of linearly independent equations: 7
Indices of linearly independent equations (starting at 0):

Integrals that can be reduced with these equations:
Int[2,-1]
Int[1,-1]
Int[2,0]
Possible Master Integrals:
Int[1,0]
Doing backward substitution.
Final representations of the integrals will look like:
Int[2,-1] -> {Int[1,0]}
Int[1,-1] -> {Int[1,0]}
Int[2,0] -> {Int[1,0]}
The probability that too many equations were discarded
 is less than 9.219628172019156e-9
Timings:
Parsing and preparing equations: 0.000514s
Solving Equations: 0.000517s
#+END_SRC
First, ICE reports the values of the command line arguments given.
Next, the number of equations and integrals, as well as the number of
integrals that lie within the region given by the values of =rmax=
and =smax= is listed.  

After that, the actual algorithm starts.  The prime number and
evaluation point is given, followed by the number of linearly
independent equations and their positions in the input file (starting
with zero).  This is the main information of interest for a
subsequent run of Laporta's Algorithm.  With the option =--dumpfile=,
it is possible to write this list to a separate file.

Finally, we get information on which integrals were reduced and which
are considered master integrals.  In case the =--backsub= option is
given, ICE also gives a lists of which master integrals appear in the
expression for each integral that could be reduced.
