ICE -- Integration-By-Parts Chooser of Equations

ICE is a program to choose a maximal linearly independent subset from
a given set of Integration-by-Parts and/or Lorentz Invariance
equations.

* Installation

The easiest way to compile the program from source is to use the cabal
build system.  It is included in the Haskell Platform

http://www.haskell.org/platform/, 

which is available on most modern systems, including GNU/Linux,
Windows, and OS/X.  If you have the Haskell Platform installed, the
following commands, executed from the source directory, will install
all needed libraries and compile the program

cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal configure
cabal build

This will create the executable file ./dist/build/ice/ice.

* Documentation

A Manual is found in ./doc/ice-manual.pdf, and an example input file
can be found in example/se1l.in.
