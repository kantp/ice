ICE is a program to choose a maximal linearly independent subset from
a given set of Integration-by-Parts and/or Lorentz Invariance
equations.

## Installation

The easiest way to compile the program from source is to use the stack build tool, avaialble at https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack.

Executing

```
stack install
```

in the directory containing the sources of ice will install the ice executable to $HOME/.local/bin/ice.
