Module: Ice.ParseIbp
Description: Parser for Integratio-By-Parts equations.

The system of equations can either be parsed as it is, or evaluating
the coefficient polynomials on the fly.  Evaluating on the fly reduces
memory usage, while keeping the coefficient polynomials allows
multiple runs of the algorithm using different evaluation points (to
reduce the probability that the algorithm finds a sub-optimal
solution).
